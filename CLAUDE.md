# Motion Thumbnails Project Status

## Project Overview
A client-side web application for creating animated thumbnails from videos. Users can extract frames, create smooth transitions, and export as WebM, GIF, or MP4 formats. All processing happens in the browser.

## Current State (As of last session)
The application is fully functional with all core features implemented:

### ✅ Completed Features
1. **Video Upload & Processing**
   - Drag-and-drop or click to upload videos
   - Automatic frame extraction based on video duration
   - Client-side processing (no server required)

2. **Frame Selection UI**
   - Grid view of extracted frames with thumbnails
   - Multi-select with checkboxes
   - Toolbar with All/None/Invert selection buttons
   - Visual feedback with 2px accent border on selected frames

3. **Settings Controls**
   - Frame duration control (0.2-10 seconds)
   - Transition duration control (0-2 seconds)
   - Shadcn-style sliders synchronized with number inputs
   - Real-time total duration calculation

4. **Preview System**
   - Canvas-based real-time preview
   - Play/Pause/Loop controls
   - Frame counter and time display
   - Seamless looping with shortened last frame (50% duration)
   - Fade transition back to first frame

5. **Export Functionality**
   - WebM export using MediaRecorder API
   - GIF export via web worker
   - MP4 export using ffmpeg.wasm
   - Auto-download on export completion
   - Progress bars with percentage and status text

6. **UI/UX Polish**
   - Modern monochrome design with #393BFF accent color
   - Black header with "Email Clark" link
   - Full-screen editor layout (no card-in-card)
   - Responsive design with proper mobile layout
   - SEO meta tags and social sharing preview

## Recent Changes
- Added shadcn-style sliders for duration controls
- Fixed mobile header to keep title and email link in single row
- Implemented force display for export progress bars
- Added comprehensive favicon and Open Graph meta tags

## Known Issues
1. **Export Progress Bars**: Recently debugged - now using `style.display = 'flex'` to force visibility
2. **Safari Compatibility**: WebM export may not work in Safari

## Key Technical Details
- **Canvas Animation**: Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth preview
- **Timeline Calculation**: Special logic for seamless looping (last frame 50% duration)
- **Worker Communication**: Structured message passing for GIF/MP4 export progress
- **Slider Implementation**: Custom pointer events with keyboard support
- **Responsive Grid**: CSS Grid with `minmax()` for frame thumbnails

## Next Steps (Optional)
1. Add video trimming controls before frame extraction
2. Implement custom frame selection (manual timestamps)
3. Add more transition effects (fade, slide, zoom)
4. Support for preset export sizes/qualities
5. Batch processing for multiple videos

## Testing Checklist
When resuming development, test:
- [ ] Upload various video formats
- [ ] Frame selection UI interactions
- [ ] Slider and number input synchronization
- [ ] Preview playback and looping
- [ ] All three export formats
- [ ] Progress bar visibility during export
- [ ] Mobile responsive behavior
- [ ] Auto-download after export

## Dependencies
- No NPM packages required
- FFmpeg.wasm files needed in `libs/` directory (see README.md)
- Modern browser with Web Workers support

## Deployment
Configured for Netlify deployment with:
- `netlify.toml` for headers and MIME types
- `_headers` file for CORS and caching
- Static file serving (no build process)
